# SIV-Glass-Height

The problem we aimed to tackle is the accurate __measurement of liquid height in a transparent glass__ using only an image. \
Traditional measurement methods rely on direct physical contact, but in scenarios where automation, remote estimation, or digital analysis is required, a computer vision-based approach becomes essential.
This study focuses on developing a __non-intrusive method__ to estimate the liquid level in a glass, which can be applicable in various domains such as:
  - __Food and Beverage Industry:__ Automated quality control in beverage filling lines.
  - __Healthcare and Nutrition:__ Monitoring fluid intake for medical applications.
  - __Smart Kitchens:__ Estimating liquid levels in smart cooking and IoT-enabled devices.
